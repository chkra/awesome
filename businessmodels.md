# Business Modelling Resources


## Business Model Canvas

* [strategyzer.com](https://strategyzer.com) Creators of the original Business Model Canvas. Contains [additional material](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas) for team alignment and portfolio management, offers all sorts of consulting services for innovation management.
* [canvanizer](https://canvanizer.com/new/business-model-canvas) Great tool for digital BMCs.
* [gruenderplattform.de](https://gruenderplattform.de/) (in German) Large page with many resources on brainstorming, designing and financing business ideas. Also resources on funding and legal advice.
* [Startup Guide Berlin](https://startupguide.com/shop/startup-guide-berlin) Not excactly a guide, rather a large collection of advertisements on Berlin startups. Nice inspiration for typical "Berlin-flavored" business models.
* [Tech Open Air](https://toa.berlin/) Very "Berlin-flavored" festival / conference / networking event for startups, outdoor meditation classes and gluten-free veggy latte included. Lots of fun, but not the most informative event.
* [Why BMCs are bad](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/business-model-canvas-good-tool-bad-instructions-rod-king-ph-d-/) Excellend summary of a book by R. King on problems related to BMCs. In particular
  * they focus on the solution, not the pain of the customer
  * they are time agnostic, ignoring change, development, growth or interaction between blocks
  * the associated process is cost-intensive and unsuited for startups
